# Pretext: Company Feedback Survey (Gift Card Reward)

## Scenario
This phishing simulation claims to be a company-wide feedback survey offering a small reward (like a $10 Amazon gift card). Victims are tricked into clicking the survey link.

## Subject Line Ideas
- "Take Our 1-Minute Survey – Get a $10 Amazon Gift Card"
- "We Value Your Feedback (Reward Inside)"
- "Complete Your Survey by Friday"

## Key Elements
- "Reward for participation" hook
- Fake survey page or “claim your gift” button
- Friendly tone with company branding

## Ethical Use
Make it clear in training follow-up that real IT never uses gift cards as a reward.
