# Pretext: Fake Invoice From Vendor

## Scenario
This simulation impersonates a known vendor or accounting contact and sends an urgent invoice for review and payment. The email includes a "View Invoice" link or attachment.

## Subject Line Ideas
- "Invoice 8742A from [Vendor Name] – Due Today"
- "Action Required: Payment Reminder"
- "Outstanding Invoice Notification"

## Key Elements
- Pretend it's from a real vendor or internal billing dept
- Use PDF icon or “Download Invoice” button
- Build urgency: "Avoid late fees," "Final notice"
- Optional: spoof domain like `vendor-support.com`

## Ethical Use
For simulation only. Do not spoof real vendors or send real attachments.
