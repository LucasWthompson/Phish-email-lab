# Pretext: Corporate Password Expiration Notice

## Scenario
This simulates an internal IT helpdesk email warning the recipient that their password is about to expire. Clicking the link would take them to a fake internal reset page.

## Subject Line Ideas
- "Your password will expire in 1 day â€“ reset now"
- "Important: Password reset required"
- "Immediate Action Required: Password Expiration"

## Key Elements
- Claims password is expiring soon
- Generic IT signature block
- Link goes to a fake reset portal or "internal dashboard"

## Ethical Use
Use only in authorized tests with full consent. Customize language to match the org's real emails.
